# Step-by-Step: Create GitHub Repository and Deploy

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open your browser and go to: https://github.com
   - **Log in** to your account (username: `judyloved`)

2. **Create New Repository:**
   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
   - Select **"New repository"**

3. **Fill in Repository Details:**
   - **Repository name:** `lilac-photobooth`
   - **Description (optional):** "A web-based photobooth application with camera capture and frame selection"
   - **Visibility:** Choose **Public** (so GitHub Pages works for free) or **Private**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check any of these:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license
   - (Leave them all unchecked - you already have these files!)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

5. **After creating, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions - DON'T follow those yet!** 
   - Just note that the repository is created
   - Come back here for the next steps

## What to Do After Creating the Repo

After you create the repository on GitHub, let me know and I'll help you push your code!

Or, if you want to do it yourself, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

But wait - let me check if everything is ready first!
